Here are some things that are mildly interesting but not so useful to be included elsewhere.

### Phelen (ポレン)

Phelen is an annual online event where you design original virtual characters to battle (and watch them [fight](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm34401380) and die). Some of my previous entries:
 - 2021: [An Ad from Dharmadhatu](http://andymente.moo.jp/lucifer/member/index.php?p=phelen4charpage&charid=561&phelen_mode=9)
 - 2020: [A Yukata from Meiji 13](http://andymente.moo.jp/lucifer/member/index.php?p=phelen4charpage&charid=448&phelen_mode=8)
 - 2018: [The Great Language of Rust](http://andymente.moo.jp/lucifer/member/index.php?p=phelen4charpage&charid=608&phelen_mode=6), [Duke of Burgundy](http://andymente.moo.jp/lucifer/member/index.php?p=phelen4charpage&charid=613&phelen_mode=6)

Also check out some of my acquintances'[^1] [entries](http://andymente.moo.jp/lucifer/member/index.php?p=phelen4charpage&charid=620&phelen_mode=6).


[^1]: We used to be online *friends*, but now barely talk to each other. Times change; how sad.
