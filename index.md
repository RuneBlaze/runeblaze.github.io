### Profile

Applied type theorist gone haywire, doing GenAI-ish random stuff for now. I recently won Google's Gemini API developer competition's best game category, via [Pen Apple](https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/pen-apple).

My reflection on the process:

> 最後に、この「同人ゲーム」系の影響を強く受けたPen Appleが賞を取れるなんて本当に嬉しいです。アメリカ的な「Indie Game」からも多少影響を受けていますが、むしろ日本の鮮やかな「同人文化」がアメリカのIT系コンペでも評価された証だと言えるかもしれません🙂。

> (A brief translation: I'm so happy that Pen Apple, a game that was heavily influenced by the 'doujin game' scene, was able to win an award. While it also drew some inspiration from American-style 'indie games', I see this as a testament to how Japan's vibrant 'doujin culture' can be recognized even in an American tech competition 🙂.)

I had brief stints in the RPG Maker sphere and Touhou doujin music sphere. You might know me from those periods.
