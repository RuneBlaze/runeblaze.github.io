### Profile

Fourth year CS PhD Student @ UIUC <em class="deemph">/</em> high performance data analytics <em class="deemph">/</em> bioinformatics.

I write high performance code for analyzing and moving huge amounts of data. My tools of choice
are Rust, Python, and C++. I like *efficient* data movements, including zero-copy and cache-friendly,
efficient layouts. I subscribe to the Arrow ecosystem (e.g., Parquet, Polars). More broadly, I care about the low levels of storing data and processing data fast.

During my research I applied my high performance data analysis skills into developing perhaps the fastest, yet still accurate, software to infer species trees (evolutionary
trees on species) in Rust (see [here](https://github.com/RuneBlaze/internode)). The data structure behind
this software is now packaged as a [Python library](https://github.com/RuneBlaze/fifteen) and deployed to speed up other bioinformatics [software](https://github.com/ytabatabaee/Quintet-Rooting). 

I also very recently worked on supervised learning for phylogenetics. I previously was interested in functional programming and game development.
