A list of works that I have done, a portfolio aimed for industry.

### Research Software

#### [WITCH-NG](https://github.com/RuneBlaze/WITCH-NG)

 - Bioinformatics tool for adding unaligned fragments to a reference multiple-sequence alignment.
 - The most accurate software of its class (building on [WITCH](https://github.com/c5shen/WITCH)), but redesigned with better performance in Rust with some algorithmic simplification.

-----

#### [Internode](https://github.com/RuneBlaze/internode)

 - Bioinformatics tool that infers accurate (almost head-to-head with state-of-the-art) species trees, but very fast.
 - The fastest (while competitive accuracy) software of its class.

-----

#### [Fifteen](https://github.com/RuneBlaze/fifteen)

 - Python bioinformatics library that contains data structures for querying topologies on phylogenetic trees.
 - Implements sparse tables (for fast LCA querying) and uses Maturin and PyO3 for the Rust-Python bridge

-----

### Other Software

#### [Coarse](https://github.com/RuneBlaze/coarse) -- A Lens Library for Clojure

 - A lens (functional setters and getters) library, implemented in Clojure but in a Haskell style.

-----

#### [Siki.lua](https://github.com/BakaBBQ/siki.lua) -- Frame Editor for Fighting Games

 - An interactive GUI editor for frame data usable for fighting games powered by Love2D using Lua.

### Music

I used to arrange music for fun, but it did not take long before others to rightfully realize
that knowing to play the piano as an amateur is totally different from being able to arrange music.

Note that links are to Netease Cloud Music (somewhat a Chinese Spotify) and that the music
can be bad. All music were made as part of the group [Mad Hatter Tea](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/%E7%96%AF%E5%B8%BD%E5%AD%90%E8%8C%B6%E4%BC%9A).

#### Qingdao THOnly 2017 Album ("MhT X 青岛THO纪念专辑", 2017, in collaboration with 核弹阿茶)

I used to *very* casually compete at ACM-ICPC.
