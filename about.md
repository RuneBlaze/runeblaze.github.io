> A medium-sized creature prone to great ambition.

This is the work-in-progress site of RuneBlaze aka Baqiao Liu. I am current a PhD student
at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and (in a very clich√© way) broadly interested
in many aspects of computing.

In my research, I mainly design applied algorithms for computational biology (by applied
I mean that unfortunately I don't get to use or even really understand cool stuffs such as Chebyshev's inequality or expanders
or even segment trees), but I consider my "true" self to be quite isolated from what I do for research.

Here are some links that are more in-line with my interests and my background:
