Applied type theorist gone haywire, doing GenAI full-time for now. I recently won Google's Gemini API developer competition's best game category, via [Pen Apple](https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/pen-apple).

My game making influence can be high-level summarized, in my own words, as:

> 最後に、この「同人ゲーム」系の影響を強く受けたPen Appleが賞を取れるなんて本当に嬉しいです。アメリカ的な「Indie Game」からも多少影響を受けていますが、むしろ日本の鮮やかな「同人文化」がアメリカのIT系コンペでも評価された証だと言えるかもしれません🙂。

> (A brief translation: I'm so happy that Pen Apple, a game that was heavily influenced by the 'doujin game' scene, was able to win an award. While it also drew some inspiration from American-style 'indie games', I see this as a testament to how Japan's vibrant 'doujin culture' can be recognized even in an American tech competition 🙂.)

I had brief stints in the RPG Maker sphere (under [RuneBlaze](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1074190/Dragon_Spirits/) and [LBQ](https://rpg.blue/thread-304811-1-1.html)) and Touhou doujin music sphere (under [LBQ](https://thwiki.cc/LBQ), of the circle Mad Hatter Tea). You might know me from those periods.
